    <p>Please note that your use of and access to the services (defined below), including any access to FamousParking locations (defined below) are subject to the following terms. If you do not agree to all of the following terms, you may not use or access the services in any manner.</p>
    
    <h3>1. Agreement to Terms</h3>
    <p>These Terms of Service (the "Terms") are a binding legal agreement between you and FamousParking, Inc. ("FamousParking", "we", "us" or "our"). The terms "user," "you" and "your" refer to the individual or entity that uses the websites, applications, and other online products and services provided by us and online and offline services related thereto, including physical locations where our technology is used, and including any services, transactions, or engagement you might have with us (collectively, the "Services"). By using our Services, whether as a digital user accessing the online aspects of the Services (either directly or through a third-party platform) or as a visitor to one of our or our customers’ or business partners’ physical locations (an "FamousParking Location"), you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use or access the Services, including any FamousParking Location or Product. If you use the Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity, your acceptance of the Terms will be deemed an acceptance by that entity, and "you" and "your" herein shall refer to that entity, its directors, officers, employees, and agents.</p>

    <h3>2. Changes to these Terms or the Services</h3>
    <p>Except for Section 16, providing for binding arbitration and waiver of class action rights, FamousParking reserves the right, at its reasonable and sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Changes will be effective immediately unless otherwise provided. If we determine a revision to the Terms, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you as required by law. Use of the Services by you after any modification to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of the Terms as modified. If you do not accept the changes, you must discontinue using the Services.</p>
    <p>FamousParking reserves the right at any time to modify, suspend, discontinue, or terminate, temporarily or permanently, the Services or any part thereof, with or without notice.

    <h3>5. Parking Payments and Monthly Permits</h3>
    <p>FamousParking requires payment for use of the Services (or certain portions thereof). By using our Services, you agree to the pricing, payment, and billing policies posted or otherwise communicated to you. FamousParking offers multiple options to use the Services including options for Hourly or Daily Basis (a "Parking Payment") or purchasing a Monthly Permit with a recurring monthly payment ("Monthly Permit") for such use. Special pricing and/or eligibility terms may apply to certain offers and Monthly Permits.</p>

    <h4>A. General</h4>
    <p>Whether you make a Parking Payment or purchase a Monthly Permit (each, a "Transaction"), you expressly authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge you for such Transaction and future Transactions via the payment features of the Services. We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, including your credit card number(s), the expiration date of your credit card(s) and your email and postal addresses for billing and notification (such information, "Payment Information"). We (or our third-party payment processor) may authorize charges using your Payment Information in anticipation of Monthly Permit or other Service-related payments in advance. In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization. You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When you initiate a Transaction, you authorize us to provide your Payment Information to third parties so we can complete your Transaction and to charge your payment method for the type of Transaction you have selected (plus any applicable taxes and other charges). You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information). All payments for Transactions are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms. All fees and applicable taxes, if any, are payable in United States dollars. For certain Payment Information, the issuer of the payment method may charge you certain additional fees (e.g., foreign transaction fees or processing fees). You will be solely responsible for such fees. You remain responsible for any amounts we are unable to collect for your use of the Services.</p>

    <h4>B. Service Fee</h4>
    <p>Each Transaction is subject to a fee (each a "Service Fee"). Service Fees are charged in connection with each Transaction and are calculated based on a formula specific to the Services. The application of a Service Fee and the rate is set by FamousParking in its sole discretion.</p>

    <h4>C. Monthly Permits and Renewal</h4>
    <p>For certain features of the Services you’ll need a Monthly Permit. If you purchase a Monthly Permit, you will be charged the Monthly Permit fee for the applicable period, plus any applicable taxes, and other charges, at the beginning of your Monthly Permit and automatically at the beginning of each subsequent Monthly Permit period commencing thereafter. BY PURCHASING A MONTHLY PERMIT, YOU AUTHORIZE FAMOUSPARKING TO AUTOMATICALLY INITIATE RECURRING NON-REFUNDABLE PAYMENTS AS SET FORTH BELOW. Your Monthly Permit will automatically continue at the selected interval, and we (or our third-party payment processor) will automatically charge at the beginning of each new Monthly Permit period commencing after the initial period for your Monthly Permit, using the Payment Information you have provided, unless prior to the end of the current period: (a) you terminate your Account; (b) you cancel your Monthly Permit; (c) we decline to renew your Monthly Permit; or (d) these Terms are otherwise properly terminated as expressly permitted herein. We may receive updated credit card information (new credit card number or updated expiration date) from your credit card issuer. We may use these new details in order to help prevent any interruption to the Services. If you would like to use a different payment method or if there is a change in payment method, please log in to your Account to update your billing information. Monthly Permits may include additional terms and conditions as may be described at the time of purchase or in other communications we send to you. The Monthly Permit Fee is non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Terms or in accordance with applicable law. If any Monthly Permit Fee is not paid in a timely manner, or your transaction cannot be processed, we reserve the right to suspend, disable, cancel or terminate your access to the Services or cancel your Monthly Permit. You will be responsible for paying all past due amounts.</p>

    <h4>D. Termination of your Monthly Permit</h4>
    <p>We may terminate your Monthly Permit at our sole discretion and without any notice. If we cancel your Monthly Permit, we may give you a prorated refund based on the amount of time remaining that you cannot use, provided, however, that we will not be obligated to grant you a refund if we terminate your Account or your Monthly Permit because we determine, in our sole discretion, that your actions or your use of the Services violates these Terms or any applicable law or has harmed another user.</p>

    <h4>E. Changes to the Monthly Permit</h4>
    <p>We may change the Monthly Permit terms or Monthly Permit Fees at any time on a going forward basis in our discretion. If the pricing for your Monthly Permit increases, we will notify you, and provide you an opportunity to change your Monthly Permit before applying those changes to your Account or charging you in connection with an automatic renewal. We may choose in our sole discretion to add, modify, or remove benefits and features from a Monthly Permit. Your continued use of the Services after the changes become effective will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not wish to continue with the new fees or features, you may cancel your Monthly Permit. If you accept the new Monthly Permit, its terms and conditions will apply for that renewal and all renewals going forward.</p>

    <h4>F. Autostart Payments and Courtesy Fees</h4>
    <p>FamousParking requires payment for use of the Services (or certain portions thereof). In some instances a user may access an FamousParking Location without an active Monthly Permit or Parking Payment. In order to prevent disruption to the Services or to prevent user from being in violation of the Services, FamousParking may automatically charge user with an active Account a Parking Payment for use of the Services ("Autostart Payment"). Autostart Payments may also include an additional fee ("Courtesy Fee").</p>

    <h3>6. Content</h3>
    <h4>A. User Content</h4>

FamousParking does not claim any ownership rights in any User Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to your User Content.</p>

    <h4>D. Removal of User Content</h4>

    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Releases from and against any Claims out of or in any way connected with (a) your access to or use of the Services or FamousParking Locations; (b) your User Content; (c) your violation of these Terms; or (d) your negligent act or omission or willful misconduct occurring at or in connection with any Services or FamousParking Locations. FamousParking reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with FamousParking in the defense of such matter</p>
    <p>You understand and acknowledge that FamousParking is not obliged to carry insurance on you, and the existence of insurance shall not change, alter, or increase any liability of FamousParking or affect the terms of this release, waiver of liability and indemnification under this Section [13(b)]</p>

    <h3>14. Limitation of Liability</h3>

    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER FAMOUSPARKING NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE, SYSTEM FAILURE, OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT FAMOUSPARKING OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION, IN NO EVENT WILL FAMOUSPARKING’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO FAMOUSPARKING FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO FAMOUSPARKING, AS APPLICABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES. THEREFORE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
    <p>THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN FAMOUSPARKING AND YOU.</p>

    <h3>15. Governing Law and Forum Choice</h3>
    <p>For any dispute not subject to arbitration or under the jurisdiction of a small claims court, you and FamousParking agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of any venue in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available. The Terms and the relationship between you and FamousParking shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>

    <h3>16. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h3>
    <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY — IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>
    <p>If you have a dispute with FamousParking or if FamousParking has a dispute with you and such dispute cannot be resolved informally, such dispute will be resolved on an individual basis in accordance with the provisions set forth below:</p>

    <h4>A. Initial Dispute Resolution</h4>
    <p>The parties shall use their best efforts to engage in informal dispute resolution to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Failure to engage in this process could result in the award of fees against you in arbitration. To adequately engage in this initial dispute resolution process, each party must notify the other party, in writing, of the facts of the dispute and all damages claimed. Such a writing must be sent to (a) the user’s email address on file with FamousParking, or (b) Sales@famousparking.com, whichever is applicable (“Dispute Notification”). The party receiving the Dispute Notification has thirty (30) days from receipt of the Dispute Notification to respond. The other party then has 15 days to reply to the response.</p>

    <h4>B. Binding Arbitration</h4>
    <p>If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 45 days from the time informal dispute resolution begins under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. This agreement to arbitrate is a contract governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. section 1, et seq., and evidences a transaction involving commerce. Except as explicitly set forth in this Section [16], the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator shall also be empowered to consolidate claims raised between the same parties to a single arbitration proceeding. The parties agree that the arbitrator may allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute.</p>
    <p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>


    <h4>C. Location</h4>
    <p>If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. You and FamousParking agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>

    <h4>D. Class Action Waiver</h4>
    <p>The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND FAMOUSPARKING AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Notwithstanding any other provision of these terms, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court. The parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.</p>

    <h4>E. Exception – Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</h4>

    <p>Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also elect to have disputes or claims resolved in a small claims court that are within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction. Either party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court in your state and county of residence. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party’s right to arbitration under this agreement.</p>

    <h4>F. Changes to this Section.</h4>

    <p>FamousParking will provide 30 days’ notice of any changes affecting the substance of this Section [16]. Changes will become effective on the 30th day. If you continue to use the Services after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of which FamousParking does not have actual notice are subject to the revised clause</p>
